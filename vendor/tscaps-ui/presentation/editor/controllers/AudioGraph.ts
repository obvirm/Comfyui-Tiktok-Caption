/**
 * Routes the audio of an `HTMLMediaElement` through a Web Audio
 * graph so consumers can schedule sample-accurate cuts on the
 * audio rendering clock. The chain is:
 *
 *   media element → MediaElementAudioSourceNode → GainNode → destination
 *
 * The `<video>` element's own `volume` property still scales the
 * source level in all major browsers, so volume control stays on
 * the element; the gain node here is dedicated to scheduled cuts
 * (`scheduleMuteIn` / `cancelScheduledMute`).
 *
 * Routing through Web Audio is sticky: once attached to a media
 * element, the element's audio stays inside the graph for the
 * AudioContext's lifetime. `dispose()` closes the context, which
 * releases the routing so the element can later be re-attached
 * to a new graph if needed.
 *
 * The AudioContext starts suspended in browsers that enforce the
 * autoplay gesture policy. Call `resume()` from a user gesture
 * (e.g. a play click) before audio is expected to flow.
