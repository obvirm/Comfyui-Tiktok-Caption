 * Returns a word that was previously detached (had a position override
 * committed) back to its segment's line flow by stripping only the four
 * alignment fields from its overrides. Typography overrides (color,
 * font weight, etc.) are preserved — only the position is undone, so a
 * user who carefully tweaked a word's color before moving it doesn't
 * lose that work when sending the word back home.
 *
 * No-op when the word has no overrides at all or no alignment fields
 * set; the entry is removed from the registry when stripping the
 * alignment leaves the record empty.
