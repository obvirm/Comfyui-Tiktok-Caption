/**
 * Runs registered `TemplateRecordMigration` steps in sequence to
 * upgrade an old user-template payload up to the current schema. The
 * migrator is the single place where the chain is assembled and
 * validated — gaps (missing `fromVersion`) and downgrades (record
 * newer than the target) are rejected with explicit errors so
 * deserialization never silently produces a wrong-shaped template.
 *
 * The chain runs at read-time deserialization rather than at a
 * storage-version upgrade transaction. That choice keeps the
 * migrator decoupled from any specific storage backend, without
 * per-storage upgrade hooks. The trade-off is that stale records pay
 * a migration cost on every read instead of once at the version
 * bump; if that ever shows up in profiles, a backfill is the
 * followup.
 *
 * Decoupled from IndexedDB versioning: when the shared IndexedDB
 * `DB_VERSION` bumps for an unrelated reason (a new store, a new
 * index), no template migration is required. Only bump
 * `TEMPLATE_RECORD_CURRENT_VERSION` when the template payload shape
 * itself changes.
