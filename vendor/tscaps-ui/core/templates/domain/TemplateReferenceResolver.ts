 * policy that applies when the id is missing from the underlying
 * template catalog — e.g. throw, or substitute with a fallback and
 * report through a side channel.
 *
 * Consumers (notably `ProjectSerializer`) depend on this abstraction
 * rather than `TemplateRepository` so the policy lives outside the
 * serialization mechanics.
