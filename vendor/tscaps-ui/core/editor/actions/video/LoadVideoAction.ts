 * Loads a freshly chosen video file into the editor as a brand-new editing
 * session. Delegates the full reset to `store.reset()` so the next
 * persistence event creates a new Project from the same baseline as a
 * freshly initialised app, not from whatever the previous project left
 * behind in the shared store.
 *
 * LoadProjectAction is the counterpart for opening an existing Project from
 * the dashboard; it patches the same fields directly without going through
 * this action.
