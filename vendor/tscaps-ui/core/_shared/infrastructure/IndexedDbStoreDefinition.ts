 * `IndexedDbClient` composes the list, ensures every store exists,
 * and runs each `onUpgrade` once when the database bumps version.
 *
 * The store definition is the only IndexedDB-shaped concern a feature
 * module exposes: data reads and writes go through `IndexedDbClient`
 * helpers or, for more involved transactions, through the database
 * handle the client returns from `open()`.
