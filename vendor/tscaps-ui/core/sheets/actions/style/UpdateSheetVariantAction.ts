/**
 * Switches the active sheet to a different style variant. Re-seeds
 * `styleValues` from the new variant's overrides, dropping any
 * manual per-field edits the user had applied to the previous one —
 * variant switching follows the "preset replaces local edits" rule
 * the same way template switching does. Pushes a single undo entry
 * and triggers a document re-derivation because variant overrides
 * commonly touch font size and other layout-affecting controls.
 *
 * No-ops when no sheet is active, when the picked index equals the
 * current one, or when the template ships fewer than two variants.
