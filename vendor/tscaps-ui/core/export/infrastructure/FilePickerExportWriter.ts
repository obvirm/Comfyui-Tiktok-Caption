 * touch the JS heap — the renderer streams them through to the file
 * the user selected and the export is complete the moment the stream
 * closes, so {@link finalize} has nothing to do.
 *
 * The primary path in Chromium. {@link open} rejects with an
 * `AbortError` when the user dismisses the picker; callers treat that
 * as a cancellation of the entire export.
