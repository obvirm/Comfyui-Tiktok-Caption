 * Collapses overlaps between consecutive words so each word ends no later
 * than the next word begins. Some transcribers report a word's `end`
 * past the `start` of one or several following words even though only
 * one mouth is speaking at a time.
 *
 * Words whose own `start` is already past the next word's `start` are
 * left untouched — that is an ordering bug, not an overlap, and silently
 * rewriting it would hide it.
