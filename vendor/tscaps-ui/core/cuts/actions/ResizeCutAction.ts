 * Replaces `originalRange` in the editor's cut registry with
 * `newRange`. The replacement is performed as a subtract-then-add so
 * the new range fuses with any adjacent or overlapping stored cut, and
 * a stored cut split by the subtraction settles back into the merged
 * result on the same commit. No-op when the registry already matches
 * the requested edit. Commits the previous state so the operation
 * participates in undo/redo as a single entry.
