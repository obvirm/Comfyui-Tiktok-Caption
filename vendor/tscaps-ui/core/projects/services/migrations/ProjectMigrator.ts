 * Runs registered ProjectMigrations in sequence to upgrade an old serialized
 * project payload up to a target schema version. The migrator is the single
 * place where the chain is assembled and validated — gaps (missing
 * fromVersion) and downgrades (data newer than the target) are rejected
 * with explicit errors so deserialization never silently produces a
 * wrong-shaped project.
 *
 * Each time PROJECT_SCHEMA_VERSION is bumped, register a new migration in
 * the constructor that covers the new step; otherwise old projects in
 * storage will fail to load.
