 * Re-attaches a freshly chosen video file to a project whose cached Blob
 * was evicted by the LRU policy. Used by the recovery prompt that the
 * editor route surfaces when LoadProjectAction returns
 * `videoRecovered: false`.
 *
 * Trusts the user that the file matches the project — we do not compare
 * size or fileName here. The risk of mismatch is low (the user is staring
 * at the project name and choosing a video) and a wrong file would only
 * misalign timings, which is recoverable by picking a different file.
